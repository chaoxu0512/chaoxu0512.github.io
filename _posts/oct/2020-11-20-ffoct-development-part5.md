#### 026 [Optical biopsy on head and neck tissue using full-field OCT: a pilot study](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2036959) (2014)

- An ex vivo study for head and neck cancers using FFOCT.
- How to evaluate the OCT images and histological images?
- Is multi-scale imaging an important factor in pathology?
- Sensitivity is not mentioned in this paper.

As is indicated in the main title, this paper is still a preliminary study of head and neck cancer screening using FFOCT. The main techniques of FFOCT has been developed a few years before the paper was released, and thus the authors were trying to investigate whether their FFOCT system could be applied to clinic or pre-clinic use. In this paper, non-pathologic head and neck tissues, such as oral mucosa, basal membrane and adipocytes are imaged ex vivo. In addition, some preliminary results of pathologic results are given. Corresponding histopathology is also done as a comparison. 

Part of the discussion is abstracted as below, 

> The pathological study is still at an early stage, but it allows identifying indicators of tumors such as heterogeneities in cell distribution, and surrounding stroma.
>
> Some pathological structures, such as keratin pearls, are less well perceived in FFOCT compared to histology images. Another problem is that not enough quantitative data have been available.
>
> An important advantage of the FFOCT technology is the ability to perform multiscale imaging, which  helps good diagnosis and fast cancer assessment for the pathologist. The high-resolution of FFOCT images allows for the observation of information at cellular and even subcellular level while the large field of view provide useful information in the sample histological morphology.

#### 027 [Large field, high resolution full-field optical coherence tomography: a pre-clinical study of human breast tissue and cancer assessment](https://doi.org/10.7785/tcrtexpress.2013.600254) (2014)

This paper is pre-clinical try of human breast tissue and cancer assessment.

> FF-OCT is the first ultra-high resolution optical imaging technique that combines the possibility of obtaining breast tissue images over an adequately large area, while producing images of sufficiently high resolution, thereby allowing pathologists to mimic routine histopathology diagnostic workflow by zooming in and out on the images. 

#### 028 [En-face full-field optical coherence tomography for fast and efficient fingerprints acquisition](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2051134) (2014)

High quality optical sectioning of fingers skin is obtained using FFOCT. Imaging depth is large enough to reach the epidermis-dermis interface whose topography has been considered to replace the usual fingerprints.

In this paper, as for the light source, a halogen lamp provides the full field illumination, which is spatially incoherent. The central wavelength of the effective spectrum is around 750nm. 

The two identical water-immersion microscope objectives with numerical aperture of 0.3 are placed on both of the sample and reference arms. The transverse resolution is 1.4um. 

The detector used in this experimental setup is a silicon CCD camera. A shot noise limited sensitivity of 80 dB is achieved in about 30ms for single image acquisition. Four images are adopted to generate an en face image by phase shift method. 

If larger penetration depth is desired for fingerprints imaging, a light source with longer central wavelength, for example, 1300nm, can be adopted to reduce the scattering. As a result, the corresponding InGaAs 2D chips can be used as the detector.

Burned or wounded fingers are not considered in this paper.

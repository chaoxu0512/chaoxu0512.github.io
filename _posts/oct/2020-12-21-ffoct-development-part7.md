#### 036 [Internal Fingerprint imaging with Visible Light Full-Field Optical Coherence Tomography](https://doi.org/10.1364/TRANSLATIONAL.2016.TTh1B.4) (2016)

A compact FF-OCT system is operating in the visible light spectrum and is able to produce en face images of internal fingerprint.

#### 037 [Dynamic full field optical coherence tomography: subcellular metabolic contrast revealed in tissues by interferometric signals temporal analysis](https://doi.org/10.1364/boe.7.001511) (2016)

In this paper, the time independence of the full field optical coherence tomography interferometric signals is used to reveal subcellular metabolic contrast in ex vivo tissues. Taking advantage of this time dependence, different dynamics at the millisecond scale are identified on some organs in normal or pathological conditions, such as mouse brain cortex, liver and intestinal tissues.

#### 038 [Smart optical coherence tomography for ultra-deep imaging through highly scattering media](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1600370) (2016)

In this paper, a matrix approach of optical imaging is proposed to extend the penetration depth twice compared with the conventional OCT technique. This approach relies on the measurement of a time-gated reflection matrix from the scattering medium, which is directly investigated in the focal plane on a point-to-point basis.

First, an input-output analysis of the reflection matrix allows for the removal of most of the multiple scattering effect. 

After that, using the iterative time reversal, the residual multiple scattering contribution and the aberrations introduced by the scattering medium are eliminated. 

Finally, an optical imaging experiment of thick biological tissues are performed, exhibiting an extension of imaging depth by a factor of 2 compared to existing OCT systems. 

#### 038 [Rapid full-field OCT assessment of clinical tissue specimens](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2210935) (2016)

A fast FFOCT prototype was built, that provides 1cm$^2$ images with 1 Âµm resolution in 1 minute, and can accommodate samples up to 50mm diameter.

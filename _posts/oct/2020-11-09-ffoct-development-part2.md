#### 008 [Full-field optical coherence microscopy](http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1317047) (2004)

- Linnik interferometer using a tungsten halogen lamp.
- Compute the difference of two phase-opposed interferometric images to generate en face images.
- optical section ability: 0.8um; transverse resolution of 1.0um is obtained when NA is 0.5.
- Within 2s acquisition time, the shot-noise limited detection noise is 86dB.
- The images of the anterior segment of the rate eye are shown ex vivo.

#### 009 [Ultrahigh-resolution full-field optical coherence tomography](https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ao-43-14-2874) (2004)

- White-light source by a tungsten halogen lamp in a Linnik interferometer. 
- En face images are generated by a  combination of 4 interferometric images recorded by a high-speed camera (200Hz). The frequency of PZT is 50Hz.
- Axial resolution: 1.8um; transverse resolution: 0.9um with short coherence length, when NA is 0.3. The central wavelength is 800nm and the bandwidth is 300nm.
- About the dispersion mismatch of compensation: by use of an aplanetic doublet achromat lens with 300-mm focal length.
- Sensitivity of 90dB is achieved in an acquisition time of 4s per image.
- Images of plant, animal, and human tissues are shown ex vivo. The logarithmic function is used for dynamic range compression of OCT images. 

> That the axial resolution is half of the coherence length is only valid when the data is in a linear scale. The resolution of logarithmic images  will be degraded in axial and transverse directions.
>
> In addition, some variations in logarithmic scale can’t be visualized in OCT images.

- Relatively long acquisition time of 4s; the interference fringe is sensitive to the sample motion; NOT suitable for endoscopic use for its bulky size (without fiber setup)

#### 010 [Full-field OCT: applications in ophthalmology](http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?doi=10.1117/12.588649) (2005)

- Use two phase-opposed interferometric images to generate an en face image.
- Resolution: 0.7um x 0.9um (axial x transverse)
- Sensitivity: 90dB (image averaging and pixel binning)
- Ex vivo imaging of unfixed rat eyes.
-  Acquisition time: 5ms (use a xenon lamp, high speed CMOS camera) 

#### 011 [Full-field OCT: ex vivo and in vivo biological imaging applications](http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?doi=10.1117/12.589651) (2005)

- White light source by a Xenon flash lamp has a FWHM of 300 nm centered at 760 nm.
- Use inclinable glass plates placed in the reference arms to compensate dispersion mismatch.
- Put a quarter wave-plate in the sample arm to create a phase delay between the sample and reference, and then a PBS splits the interference signal into two phase-opposed images, which are detected by a pair of CCD cameras (15Hz). 

> The calibration of two cameras is critical to reduce artifacts.
>
> Compensation of polarizing effects in the cornea is difficult.

- Calculate the difference squared of these two images extracts the tomographic image of the sample.
- Axial resolution: 1um; transverse resolution: ~1um; NA = 0.8; refractive index is 1.33.
- Acquisition time: 10us per frame. 
- In vivo image of mouse embryo; ex vivo image of rat retina.
- A detection sensitivity of ~ 70 dB is achieved through 3x3 **pixel binning.**

> Pixels are binned to increase the effective full-well capacity of the CCD cameras. **Pixel binning** is the process of combining the electric charge from adjacent CMOS or CCD sensor pixels into one super-pixel, to reduce noise by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in digital cameras
>
> Incoherence light is minimized.
>
> Water-immersion objectives are used to minimize dispersion mismatch.

Basically the same as that in 011 and 012.

- A continuous 300W xenon arc lamp as the light source; an effective spectra; bandwidth of 300nm centered at 650nm.
- Acquisition speed: 4ms per en face image (PZT oscillates the reference mirror at 250Hz, the CMOS camera: 500Hz).
- An achromatic doublet lens of focal length 75 cm focuses the light exiting from the interferometer onto the sensor of a CMOS camera.
- Axial resolution: 1um; transverse resolution: 1.5um (NA = 0.3).
- Detection sensitivity: 71dB (improved by image correlation and averaging).
- In vivo imaging in the anterior segment of the rat eye.

- Transverse movements of the sample place limitations on the length of time that the eye remains in a sufficiently stable position to allow image acquisition.
- Some cellular details are not visible compared with confocal microscope.

> Detection sensitivity and dynamic range are influenced by a number of factors such as the reference mirror reflectivity, which must be approximately matched to that of the sample, the well depth of the detector pixels and the number of images accumulated and averaged. Ultimately the sensitivity is limited by camera performance. Image

If you are interested in this paper `Dynamic full field optical coherence tomography: subcellular metabolic contrast revealed in tissues by interferometric signals temporal analysis`, please find it [here](https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-7-4-1511&id=338491) [[1]](https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-7-4-1511&id=338491).

In this paper, an new imaging method called dynamic full field optical coherence tomography (D-FFOCT) is proposed, which features in subcellular metabolic contrast in fresh *ex vivo* tissues. The advantage of higher transverse resolution of FFOCT is taken to obtain intracellular features. In addition, thanks to a higher frame rate and imaging contrast, the proposed method is able to identify different dynamics in tissues. 

As mentioned above, D-FFOCT can not only perform long-term acquisitions like conventional OCT by extending the  imaging time, but also operate at short timescales (<10 ms) to see subcellular behavior with negligible cellular migration [[1]](https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-7-4-1511&id=338491). The time duration is studied in the paper - ‘the time dependence of FFOCT’. 

For the optical setup of D-FFOCT, it is the same as that of FFOCT, using a Linnik configuration with broadband light source [[2]](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-41-4-805). However, instead of moving the reference arm in FFOCT, a signal modulation of the path difference is induced by the sample movement in D-FFOCT.

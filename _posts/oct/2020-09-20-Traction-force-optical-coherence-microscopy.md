`Traction force microscopy (TFM)` plays an important role to quantify `cellular traction forces (CTFs)`, which help access the physiological processes and diseases. Here, `traction force optical coherence microscopy (TF-OCM)` is proposed to reconstruct 3D CTFs quantitatively in scattering media with minute-scale temporal sampling. In this method, the techniques of optical coherence microscopy and `computational adaptive optics (CAO)` are integrated. The experiment shows high-through, label-free, volumetric imaging in scattering media, which may prove TF-OCT advantageous for the study of large cell collectives.

``Confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM)`` is mainly employed to perform 3D TFM imaging.  However, the modality set a series of obstacles on TFM, including limited penetration depth, slow image acquisition speed, and high complexity by photobleaching and phototoxicity.

The advantages of TF-OCM:
- rapid (minute-scale) volumetric acquisition rate (due to Fourier domain OCM).
-  focal plane resolution over a large depth-of-field (thanks to CAO).
- label-free imaging with extended penetration depth (due to OCM at NIR wavelength). 

In summary, the authors showed that OCM images reconstructed with CAO techniques could be used to quantify time-varying 3D CTFs.  This was achieved by analyzing the OCM images, which were obtained with five-minute temporal sampling and a ${\text{500}} \times {\text{500}} \times {\text{500}}\mu {m^3}$ `field-of-view (FOV)`. In addition, a computational image formation procedure was developed to mitigate the artifacts in OCM images. 

However, the authors mentioned that they <u>had not yet developed the full experimental and data processing methods required to obtain quantitative reconstructions of time-varying CTFs with TF-OCM</u>.

## Deep learning for  ophthalmology OCT

[Deep learning in glaucoma with optical coherence tomography: a review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41433-020-01191-5)

## Full field OCT

After searching the OSA Publishing, pubmed, web of science and google scholar, I see the [earliest paper](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-41-4-805) related with full-field OCT appear in 2002 by Arnaud Dubois, and there are more than [200 related research papers](https://www.osapublishing.org/search.cfm?q=Segmentation%20of%20ophthalmological%20OCT&meta=1&cj=1&cc=1&cr=1). Among them I found two book chapters and one review paper, which review the progress of full-field OCT.

##  OCT in glaucoma

It’s a good and important area, but only searching google scholar, I find many researchers have done reviews in this field recently (2020).

[Macular Imaging for Glaucoma Using Spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography: A Review](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/08820538.2012.712734)

## OCT in neurodegenerative diseases

[Spectral-Domain OCT Measurements in Alzheimer’s Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161642018302586)

[Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32765149/)

[Optical coherence tomography as a biomarker for diagnosis, progression, and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/joph/2016/8503859/abs/)

## OCT in age-related macular degeneration

It’s mainly about the detection and monitoring of AMD using OCT, still, I can find a bunch of review paper in this field. 

## Segmentation of ophthalmological OCT

[Automatic choroid layer segmentation from optical coherence tomography images using deep learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39795-x)

[A review of algorithms for segmentation of optical coherence tomography from retina](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3785070/)

[Validation of automated artificial intelligence segmentation of optical coherence tomography images](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220063)

[Deep-learning based, automated segmentation of macular edema in optical coherence tomography](https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=boe-8-7-3440)

[Deep learning based retinal OCT segmentation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482519303221)

Many methods  have been utilized to segment macular OCT images, including deep learning, which is a quite hot area. If I focus on AI-based segmentation, I’m afraid that I might have to go deep into some neural networks. I’m not vey sure about this.

**As a review paper, the scope should not be too narrow or broad. If I choose full-field OCT as my review topic, I might need to read related paper, and then narrow the topic a bit.**

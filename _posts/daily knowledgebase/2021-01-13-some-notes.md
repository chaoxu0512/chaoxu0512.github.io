1.怎样清理photdiode的表面呢？可参考[这里](https://www.aptechnologies.co.uk/support/SiPDs/handling#:~:text=Optical%20Cleaning&text=To%20clean%20a%20detector%2C%20any,free%20swab%20or%20lens%20tissue.)：

*Although photodiodes in packages or in chip form are reasonably rugged, avoid touching the cell or package window with bare fingers.*

*To clean a detector, any dust or loose particles should first be blown away using dry compressed gas. The detector surface or window can then be cleaned by using a lint free swab or lens tissue moistened with isopropyl alcohol and gently wiping the element with a clean, lint free swab or lens tissue. Repeat the wiping procedure for stubborn contamination.*

*Electronic grade alcohol is preferred for high shunt resistance/low dark current devices without a protective cover.*

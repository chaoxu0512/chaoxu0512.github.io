**1.**在Optical Coherence Tomography - Technology and Applications的第10页中，提到：

*Using low-coherence length light, interference only occurs when the path lengths are matched to within the coherence length*。

为什么要在OCT系统中使用弱相干光，就是为了获得较小的相干长度，而理论的轴向分辨率是相干长度的2倍。因此，这样就可以得到更小的轴向分辨率。补充一下相关内容：

*Low-coherence light can be characterized as having statistical phase discontinuities over a distance known as the coherence length, which is inversely proportional to the frequency bandwidth of the light. When low-coherence light is used, interference is only observed when the measurement and reference path lengths are matched to within the coherence length.*

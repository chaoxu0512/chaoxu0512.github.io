## Visible-light optical coherence tomography oximetry based on circumpapillary scan and graph-search segmentation 

(For rats) First, we changed the 50/50 cube beam splitter to a **30/70 (sample/reference arm) cube beam splitter** for increased sample arm collection efficiency. Second, to increase our field-of-view, the Keplerian telescope was modified to a **6:1 magnification** (previously 5:1), using a pair of 150 mm and 25 mm achromatic lenses. In addition to the larger magnification, these lenses had a 1-inch diameter (previous 0.5 inch), enabling a larger scanning angle from the galvanometers to be used without image distortion from the lens edges. Illumination power at the pupil was ~1 mW.

## Ultrahigh resolution retinal imaging by visible light OCT with longitudinal achromatization

 ![image-20210123223724276](http://imghost.cx0512.com/images/2021/01/23/20210123223724.png)

A 7 mm focal length protected silver reflective collimator (90° off-axis parabolic mirror, **RC02APC-P01**, Thorlabs Inc.) was used to collimate without introducing chromatic aberrations (instead of refractive collimator).

N-BK7 glass was used in the reference arm to approximately match chromatic dispersion caused by the AL in the sample arm. All other sample arm lenses were matched by identical lenses in the reference arm. The eye dispersion was coarsely balanced by a 20 mm water cell in the reference arm. Residual second- and third-order dispersion mismatches were numerically corrected in post-processing to optimize the axial image resolution.

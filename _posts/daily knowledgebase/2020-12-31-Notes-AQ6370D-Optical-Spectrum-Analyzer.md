The user manual for AQ6370D Optical Spectrum Analyzer can be found [here](https://cdn.tmi.yokogawa.com/1/6058/files/IMAQ6370D-01EN.pdf). I will list some notes or confusions I met during reading this manual.

> The wavelength range of input light that can be auto-measured is 1200–1670 nm.

This is the auto-measured wavelength range, including span, center wavelength, reference level, and resolution.

> PEAK→CENTER: Sets the peak wavelength or the peak frequency of the active trace measurement waveform to center wavelength or center frequency.

What’s meaning of peak wavelength ?

> MEAN WL→CENTER: Sets THRESH 3 dB center wavelength or center frequency of the active trace measured waveform to center wavelength or center frequency.

???

> VIEW→MEAS: Sets the currently displayed ZOOM scale as the measurement scale (CENTER, START, STOP, SPAN) for the next sweep.

How to implement it? Wait to try.

> Δλ→SPAN: Sets the sweep width as six times the RMS 20 dB width of the active trace measurement waveform.

Can not understand this sentence.

**For the above questions, it is suggested to see sections 5.4 to 5.6 for the operating procedure.**

Seems that much should be done from the beginning.

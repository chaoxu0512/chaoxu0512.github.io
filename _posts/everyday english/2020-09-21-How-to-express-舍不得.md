**1. When you are leaving from your friend, a heartfelt way to express this:**

We only have a few short weeks left together.

It’s going to be very difficult to start the next chapter of our lives without you being there.

But I want you to know that I really appreciate all the times we were able to spend together.

I hope we can stay friends wherever we go and keep in touch.



**2. When you care about something, you can express like this:**

This is very important to me. My mom made it for me. It’s not just any necklace. It’s one of a kind. I don’t want anything to happen to it, so I’m saving it for something special.

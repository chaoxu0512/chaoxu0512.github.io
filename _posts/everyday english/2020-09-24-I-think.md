(1) **As far as something goes, I would / I wouldn’t...** 

> As far as the new project goes, The only thing I would point out is the timing.

(2) **From where I stand** / From a (marketing) perspective / From my point of view / The way I see it, timing could be an issue.

(4) **I do believe** we’ve still got a long way to go.  

(5) **To me sounds like** we’ve pretty much covered every ground, and I think we are good to go.  It sounds like a solid plan.

(6) **Judging from what I’ve read/heard**, it doesn’t seem like we have a solution to this issue yet, and this is a very important aspect as to whether we could be successful or not. So I would recommend/suggest that we get this taken care of before we move onto the next step.

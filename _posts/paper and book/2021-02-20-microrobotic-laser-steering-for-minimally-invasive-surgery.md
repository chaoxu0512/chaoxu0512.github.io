In this paper [Microrobotic laser steering for minimally invasive surgery](https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/6/50/eabd5476), a new mirror design is proposed for laser steering application. 

Integrated with present surgical tools, this device is 6 millimeters in diameter and 16 millimeters in length and is able to focus and steer a fiber-based laser beam at high speed (1.2 kilohertz bandwidth) over a range of more than Â±10 degrees  in both of two axes.

The author mentioned that a three-mirror design can actually be **made smaller** than a two-mirror design, if the same range of motion is desired for each. 

Also, for scanning applications with **forward looking**, three-mirror design is recommended.  On the other hand, a two-mirror design would be perfectly acceptable in terms of miniaturization and range of motion.

Because the distance that the laser travels through the three-mirror design changes very little as the mirror angles change, the focal plane is nearly symmetric about the neutral configuration. This is not the case for the two-mirror designs; the distance that the laser travels between the mirrors changes drastically with changing mirror angles. This yields the **deformed focal plane** that is contracted for large negative values of the first-mirror rotation angle.

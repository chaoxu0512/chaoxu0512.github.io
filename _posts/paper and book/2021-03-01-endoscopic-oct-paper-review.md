Based on the direction of the imaging beam with respect to the longitudinal axis of the probe, OCT endoscopes can be divided into `side-viewing` endoscopes and `forward-viewing` endoscopes.  

Based on the location of the beam scanning device, OCT endoscopes can be divided into proximal-end scanning probes and distal-end scanning probes.

(15) 2021-07-08: [Broadband rotary joint for high-speed ultrahigh-resolution endoscopic OCT imaging at 800 nm](https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.42.004978)

> The polarization state of the sample and reference arm was carefully managed by using polarization controllers to maximize the interference fringe contrast.

> The fluctuation in the double-pass coupling efficiency was measured by connecting a short piece (∼5 cm long) of flat cleaved fiber to the rotary arm. The fluctuation of backreflected light intensity from the fiber tip during circumferential  scanning was measured to be less than ±2% at a speed of 5 revolution/s (rps).   

(14) 2021-07-04: [Improved signal-to-noise ratio in spectral-domain compared with time-domain optical coherence tomography](https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.28.002067)

> The shot-noise density per detector element is reduced by a factor of 2 because only half of the reference arm’s optical power is incident upon each detection element.  

> Extending the above analysis demonstrates that the shot-noise contribution to the system is reduced by a factor approximately equal to the number of detectors over which the spectrum is dispersed.  

> <u>*By use of Nyquist’s theorem, the bandwidth per detector element (BW/M) in Eq. (8) is replaced by 1/(2${\tau _i}$), where ${\tau _i}$ is the integration time of the array.*</u>  

> In conclusion, the increased SNR in SD OCT compared with that of TD OCT is based on the significant reduction of shot noise obtained by replacement of the single-element detector with a multielement array detector.

> The objective-first inverse method is used to design a metalens, which can be fabricated on the tip of a single mode fibre. The circular metalens can transform the parallel waveform to spherical wavefront, with a focal length of 8 um at the wavelength of 980 nm and a focal spot of 100 nm. For its demonstration use, the metalens is integrated with a 780 nm laser platform for two-photon direct laser lithography.

> Insight: Can I use this design method to create desired pattern for ball lens used in the catheter? 

> Limitation: Manual control in the z-axis for the laser lithography.

> A 25-gauge hypodermic tube with a side opening was employed to protect the distal end, and a torque coil of a 600 µm diameter was used to protect the rest of the optical fiber and transfer rotation from the proximal to the distal end for performing circumferential beam scanning.

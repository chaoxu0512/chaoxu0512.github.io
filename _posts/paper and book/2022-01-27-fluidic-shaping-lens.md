It is not the first time that I read the paper "Fabrication of freeform optical components by fluidic shaping", but I have to admit that I did not get a very good understanding of it. This time, at least I can throw some questions to myself and offer a certain way for the next step to progress. (By the way, I emailed the first author to ask for suggestions to repeat his work, wow, he was very nice and responsive!)

1. The first question is how to obtain the value of the interfacial energy $\gamma$ between two liquids? Is it measured from the experiments? or is it only a  variable used in the analytical simulation? This interfacial energy is used to calculate the Bond number in the simulation. For now, I prefer the second option. 

{ $ B o=\frac{R_{0}^{2}}{\ell_{c}^{2}}=\frac{|\Delta \rho| g R_{0}^{2}}{\gamma} $ }

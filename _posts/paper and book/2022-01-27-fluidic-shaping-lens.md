It is not the first time that I read the paper "Fabrication of freeform optical components by fluidic shaping", but I have to admit that I did not get a very good understanding of it. This time, at least I can throw some questions to myself and offer a certain way for the next step to progress. (By the way, I emailed the first author to ask for suggestions to repeat his work, wow, he was very nice and responsive!)

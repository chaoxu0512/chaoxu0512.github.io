Welcome to visit, I'm Chao Xu! I obtained B.Eng. in Opto-Electronics Information Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, 2017. After that, I received M.Sc. in Optics, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2020. Currently, Iâ€™m a PhD student in the [Advanced Biophotonics Imaging Lab](http://www.bme.cuhk.edu.hk/yuan/index.html), CUHK. My research interests include high-resolution OCT technologies and preclinical/clinical studies with OCT.
